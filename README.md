# The University of Delhi undertook an elaborate exercise of the process of updating and modernizing all its undergraduate and postgraduate programmes in the year 2018-19 and incorporated Learning Outcome Based Curriculum Framework (LOCF) and revised the courses under the Choice-Based Credit System (CBCS). The revised courses are effective from the academic year 2019-20 and are available to the students enrolled either in regular or distance learning mode of the University. Revised undergraduate courses are also applicable to the students of School of Open Learning (SOL) as well as the students of Non-Collegiate Women Education Board (NCWEB). These courses are expected to benefit close to seven lakh students enrolled under regular and distance learning (SOL) mode as well as NCWEB. It is notable that the revised courses in distance learning mode are at par with those in conventional mode. The revised courses take care of varied learning needs of the students in terms of learning outcomes, knowledge outcomes, skill outcomes and personality outcomes. Courses covering the varied learning needs of the students are in synchrony with the requirements of accreditation processes that the University needs to undergo and also to meet international academic standards.
